// Two dependency ceilings are load-bearing here and are not free to bump:
//
//   typescript pinned to 6.x — typescript-eslint refuses to load against TS 7
//     ("typescript-eslint does not support TS 7.0"), and eslint-config-next
//     requires it, so TS 7 takes the whole lint run down, not just the TS rules.
//     See typescript-eslint#10940.
//   eslint pinned to 9.x — eslint-config-next's peer range is a loose >=9.0.0,
//     but its transitive eslint-plugin-react (7.37.5, latest) caps at ^9.7 and
//     calls context.getFilename(), removed in ESLint 10.
//
// Raising either one re-breaks `bun run lint` outright. Re-check both upstreams
// before bumping.
