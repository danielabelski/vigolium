Reported Medium/Firm when a request parameter is reflected into the URI; a static URI is Info/Tentative, and browser no-ops (javascript:void(0)) and framework postback helpers (__doPostBack, form.submit()) are not reported.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker crafts a link or form whose URL attribute begins with javascript: (including encoded variants) from reflected input; clicking or submitting runs the script in the victim's session.

**Fix:** Reject non-http schemes and allow-list safe protocols (http/https/mailto).`
