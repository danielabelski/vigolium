Detection-only: it confirms the servlet is a specific mount but supplies no URL, so no request is triggered (Tentative).

**How it's exploited:** An attacker points the url/auth_url parameter at internal services the AEM host can reach but the internet cannot.

**Fix:** Block these proxy servlets at the dispatcher, apply Adobe's patches, and restrict the destinations they may fetch.`
