// (CloneWithoutCredentials) share one instance and the reuse ratio is scan-wide.
// It covers the net/http (retryablehttp) path only; the rawhttp path bypasses
// net/http, so its requests are not traced (a documented blind spot). A single
// ClientTrace is built once and shared across requests — its hooks close over the
// counters, which are fixed — so tracing adds one context wrap per request, not a
// fresh closure set.

	// out to undercount real connections by ~17x. Go's transport races a dial
	// against waiting for an idle conn; when the wait wins, the freshly dialed
	// connection is parked in the idle pool and handed to a *later* request, which
	// sees Reused=true. The "new" event fires on nobody's trace. Measured against a
	// server counting its own accepts: 7,990 real accepts, 453 reported as new, and
	// a ReuseRatio of 0.975 when the true figure was ~0.56. A churn metric that
	// reads healthy during heavy churn is worse than no metric, so the ratio is
